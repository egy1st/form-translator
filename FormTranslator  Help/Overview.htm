<h1><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">
<font color="#000080" size="4">Form Translator<br>
</font></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">Form 
Translator is the only program that gives you multi-language functionality 
without rewriting your code or redesigning the entire form. Developed by 
EgyFirst Software, it allows you to support Eastern languages and adapts your 
form design to accommodate foreign characters. Form Translator is perfect for 
programmers writing in multiple languages and trying to reach international 
markets.</font></span></h1>
<h1><font color="#000080" size="4">
<span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">Automatic translation<br>
</span></font><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">Form Translator 
works by taking your original form and translating the code into several 
languages. That means you only need to write one program, rather than recoding 
and redesigning with every version. Use it with Form Flipper to automatically 
rotate your form if the language calls for it. This way, you can spend more time 
polishing your project and less time slaving over repetitive code.</font></span></h1>
<h1><font color="#000080" size="4">
<span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">Simple code 
integration<br>
</span></font><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">The Form Translator 
function takes up only one line of code and appears only in the Form_Load event, 
so it won’t clutter your program. You don’t have to define it at every point or 
keep scrolling back up as you code, which saves you even more time.</font></span></h1>
<h1><font color="#000080" size="4">
<span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">Runs on COM-based 
applications<br>
</span></font><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">Form Translator 
works with any COM-based application, including Delphi, Borland C++, Visual C++, 
and Visual Basic. To use one application with multiple languages, just define 
the languages and fields on a standard table and copy it onto your project. You 
can also set the translator to match the programming language you use, and 
generate codes for foreign characters.</font></span></h1>
